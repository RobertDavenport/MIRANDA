A set of wearable assistance devices which includes LIDAR sensors and one or more video cameras on glasses frames
and modular combinable haptic feedback devices. The device is capable of continually mapping a userâ€™s environment in
relation to the user as they move and look around. The device also leverages artificial intelligence to take visual input
data from the onboard cameras to classify attributes. Processed data is relayed via audio and haptic cues to a user to allow
more situational awareness with the surrounding world. This set of devices is a novelty through the expanded
functionality of obstacle and object detection and recognition, in combination with haptic feedback.
