----Architecture for processing data----

The processing for the Adafruit feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE will be done
on arduino ide in C and C++.

---Planned Libraries----

TFLI2c - A library giving ToF (Time of Flight ) for LiDAR sensors. This
    will measure the distance to an object. Allowing us to retreive distance
    vectors to approximate objects. This library is specifically for use for
    The TF Luna, although the TF Mini Library, TFMini, also appears to be functional if issues
    arise.

SoftwareSerial - Part of arduino IDE, allowing for serialization of additional
    ports for the board. This will give us additional pins to use to connect to
    our lidar sensor, the TF Luna.
